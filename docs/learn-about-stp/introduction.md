# FAQ

# So what _is_ Serving the People? 
Serving the People is a platform built by artists interested in the intersection of creativity and technology. We provide mentorship and foster creators worldwide, to whom we have built a supportive community around. 

Our platform is built to:

- Be accessible to everyone and minimize barrier to entry;
- Allow for discovery free from the overwhelming saturation of paid and promotional content often seen when utilizing big-tech services such as Twitter and Instagram;
- Bring content directly to an audience, rather than be dictated by an algorithm.

We believe that resources are meant to be shared and accessible. We support giving power to the people similar to the original vision of the internet.

# Serving the People‚Äôs Core Beliefs

Centralized social platforms rely on outdated business models and practices that fundamentally limit creator and community engagement. Content, data, and social graphs are monopolized by outdated social networks. High-value content is being overshadowed by rigid engagement metrics. Serving the People aligns itself with web3 principles. We are building a super app that blurs the lines between social media and social commerce.
