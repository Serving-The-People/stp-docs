## Seeds FAQ
### What is the cost of the NFT?
The mint price is .1 ETH.
    
### What is an NFT?
An NFT stands for “non-fungible token” It is called this because it is verifiably unique and its value is not fungible, or cannot be traded for another token of equal value, therefore it is one-of-a-kind. This type of token is made possible through blockchain technology that ensures fraudulent claims for or against this authenticity are statistically impossible.
 
### Can I choose the Seeds packet I want?
Seeds are randomly generated at the time of minting and cannot be selected. However, once minted, specific Seeds can be acquired on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/seeds-luciensmith) via offers from the current holder.
    
### Do I need cryptocurrency to buy one?
Nope. If you visit [seeds.lobus.io](https://seeds.lobus.io/buy) you may purchase Seed(s) with a credit card. However, it will take anywhere from 24 hours to 72 hours to receive your NFT.
