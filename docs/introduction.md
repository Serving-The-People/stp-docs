# What is Serving the People?

Serving the People (STP) is an ecosystem building the future of creativity, collaboration, and communication. Guided by a network of creatives and technologists, STP aims to rebuild the infrastructure for cultural participation. By providing mentorship and support through our Foundation, STP seeks to bridge the digital with physical experiences.

# Seeds

[Seeds](docs/seeds.md) is a collection of 10,000 NFTs created by Serving the People‚Äôs founder artist¬†[Lucien Smith](https://www.luciensmithstudio.com/). The primary purpose of Seeds is to support STP. Think of Seeds as STP‚Äôs membership and ID, each NFT is unique and unlocks access to the community. For more information visit the [Seeds Page](docs/seeds.md).

# Discord

The [STP Discord](https://discord.gg/A4bJ8cCwUP) is where our community comes together, with discussion channels for art, design, illustration, jobs, advise and much more. We even have our own 24/7 radio player curated by us, and reoccurring programing such as CRIT CLUB a live interactive gathering of bright creative individuals from all over the world. All you need to join is a [Seed NFT](docs/seeds.md).

# Our Vision

We believe creativity is at the center of everything we do and love. We know creators hold the key to a more promising future; It is our goal at STP to provide them with resources, support, and community. 

We are currently building **Platform,** a decentralized web app that seeks to create a rewarding online experience with well thought out tooling and support. **Platform** will provide generations of creators with the infrastructure needed to build a better world.
