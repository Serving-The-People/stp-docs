# What is Serving the People?

Serving the People (STP) is an ecosystem building the future of creativity, collaboration, and communication. Guided by a network of creatives and technologists, STP aims to rebuild the infrastructure for cultural participation. By providing mentorship and support through our Foundation, STP aims to go beyond and bridge the digital with the real world.

# Seeds

[Seeds](docs/seeds.md) is a collection of 10,000 NFTs created by Serving the People‚Äôs founder artist¬†[Lucien Smith](https://www.luciensmithstudio.com/). The primary purpose of Seeds is to support the growth of  the Serving the People community. Think of Seeds as STP‚Äôs membership and ID, each NFT is unique and unlocks access to STP. For more information visit the [Seeds Page](docs/seeds.md).

# Our Vision

We are currently building **Platform** a decentralized web app that seeks to better reward both creator and consumer, and supercharge their online experience with well thought out tooling and support. **Platform** will provide future generations with the infrastructure needed to build a better world. 

Centralized social platforms and their outdated, extractive business models are fundamentally limiting creator and community engagement. Rather than a power law outcome where only a select few feel privileged enough to consider themselves a creator, STP believes that better tooling and social interactivity, through a better platform, will help turn everyone‚Äôs spark of creativity into a blaze.

### Why Now?

The future is at risk because of the sheer scale of the monopolies on content, data, and the social graph that the currents incumbents have. Rather than optimizing for click through and ephemeral eyeballs, STP believes in helping high value content shine through without adhering to rigid engagement metrics. 

### Why Us?

We‚Äôre a multidisciplinary team bridging the gap between culture, scalable technology, and sound economics. For 7 years we‚Äôve been cultivating an audience and building a community by providing mentorship and platform to creators worldwide through the Serving the People Foundation a 501(c)(3) organization.
