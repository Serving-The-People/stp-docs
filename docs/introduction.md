# ðŸŒŽ Introduction
Welcome to the hub of Serving the People. Here is where you will find almost everything about us, who we are and what we stand for. 

At Serving the People, we value innovation, equality, and forward thinking. At our core, Serving the People aims to rebuild the infrastructure for cultural participation. We know creators hold the key to a more promising future. We do not want to live in a world that ignores that potential.

# So what _is_ Serving the People? 
Serving the People is a platform built by artists interested in the intersection of creativity and technology. We provide mentorship and foster creators worldwide, to whom we have built a supportive community around. 

Our platform is built to:

- Be accessible to everyone and minimize barrier to entry;
- Allow for discovery free from the overwhelming saturation of paid and promotional content often seen when utilizing big-tech services such as Twitter and Instagram;
- Bring content directly to an audience, rather than be dictated by an algorithm.

We believe that resources are meant to be shared and accessible. We support giving power to the people similar to the original vision of the internet.

# Serving the Peopleâ€™s Core Beliefs

Centralized social platforms rely on outdated business models and practices that fundamentally limit creator and community engagement. Content, data, and social graphs are monopolized by outdated social networks. High-value content is being overshadowed by rigid engagement metrics. Serving the People aligns itself with web3 principles. We are building a super app that blurs the lines between social media and social commerce.

# How can I participate in Serving the People?

For Beta Testing, Serving the People will be inviting all [Seeds](docs/seeds.md) NFT holders to the platform. Each Seed will unlock posting permissions by simply connecting your wallet to the platform.

# Roadmap
