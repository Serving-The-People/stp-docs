# Serving the People

# What is STP?

Serving the People (STP) is an organization building the future of creativity, collaboration, and communication. Guided by a network of creatives and technologists, STP aims to rebuild the infrastructure for cultural participation. By providing mentorship and support through our Foundation, STP aims to go beyond and bridge the digital with the real world.

# üå±Seeds

[Seeds](docs/seeds.md) is a collection of 10,000 NFTs created by Serving the People‚Äôs founder artist¬†[Lucien Smith](https://www.luciensmithstudio.com/). The primary purpose of Seeds is to support STP. Think of Seeds as STP‚Äôs membership and ID, each NFT is unique and unlocks access to the community. For more information visit the [Seeds Page](docs/seeds.md).

# Our Vision

We believe creativity is at the center of everything we do and love. We know creators hold the key to a more promising future; It is our goal at STP to provide them with resources, support, and community.
