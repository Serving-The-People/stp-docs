Welcome to the hub of Serving the People. Here is where you will find almost everything about us, who we are and what we stand for. 

At Serving the People, we value innovation, equality, and forward thinking. At our core, Serving the People aims to rebuild the infrastructure for cultural participation. We know creators hold the key to a more promising future. We do not want to live in a world that ignores that potential.
