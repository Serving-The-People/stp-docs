- [Queens](https://opensea.io/collection/seeds-luciensmith?search[sortAscending]=true&search[sortBy]=PRICE&search[stringTraits][0][name]=Type&search[stringTraits][0][values][0]=Queens) ~6% Chance of Drop Named after historical female rulers, the Queens all bear unique stripes inspired by the many different mutations found in the tulip flower.
